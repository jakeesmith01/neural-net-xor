# neural-net-xor
A neural network built from scratch in C trained to predict the output of XOR

In its current implementation, there is an error of roughly 5%. This can be lowered by increasing the epochs, allowing the NN to train more. This is a simple neural network, built without the use of any libraries apart from standard C libs such as stdio, math, etc. 

This is my first look at neural networks and machine learning, the end goal is to combine the skills gained from this and the particle simulation to create a double pendulum simulation and train a neural network to balance it.
